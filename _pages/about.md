I am a postgraduate researcher at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), working at the cross-section of natural language processing and information retrieval. My supervisors are [Dr. Richard McCreadie](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/richardmccreadie/) and [Dr. Jeff Dalton](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/jeffdalton/). My research involves developing multi-task learning algorithms for event-related information. Other interests include explainability, social media analysis, crisis informatics, and (computational) linguistics.

I am a member of the [Glasgow Information Retrieval Group](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk) within the [Information, Data and Analytics (IDA)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/) section. I am currently involved in a project of identifying actionable information for disaster/emergency response scenarios and I am a regular [TREC](https://trec.nist.gov/} participant, particularly in the [TREC Incident Streams](http://trecis.org/) track.

I am also an organiser for [Machine Learning in Science](https://ml-in-science.github.io/webpage/) where we host regular talks and seminars on the development of machine learning and its use across different disciplines in science, and have held various teaching and marking assistant roles across the university.
